# bem3_emf_qd1
This is the three-dimensional electromagnetic field analysis program for one-dimensional periodic arrangement objects irradiated by a plane wave. 
This is based on boundary element method, the own developed numerical solution is used. 
This is the full vector field three-dimensional analysis, the corner problem free.
Intel Math Kernel Library is required. Gmsh is used for create a mesh data of object. 
The calculation program of quasi-periodic Green's function "d3_qpgf_d1" is used.

## Usage of example code
